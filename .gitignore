# Libraries (Pre-built) - We usually ignore dll/lib, but if they are in libs/, we might want them.
# However, standard practice is to ignore all binaries.
# If you want to version control vendored libs, uncomment the exceptions below.

# Note: We do not ignore *.txt because CMakeLists.txt and others are important.
